# Interactive To-Do List App with React, Typescript, and TailwindCSS

This interactive To-do List App allows users to add and delete tasks to a list. An additional information button will show a pop-up window, prompting users to enter optional information such as a due date and notes to elaborate on the task. Users can then drag and drop the task components anywhere they like within the list to organize it based on priority.
